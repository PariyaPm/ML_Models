# ML_Models
This repository has the codes for predicting land cover for binary data using four classification Machine Learning algorithms of *SVM*, *Logistic Regression*, and ensemble algorithms of *Random Forest* and *Voting Classifier*. The repo. has all the necessary elements to run ML classifiers for a binary land cover predictions.

The repo includes: data, Models, and spatialEnv directories.

## Data
This Folder includes the sample data for the developed models. We have one .txt file per variable and the dataPrep.py model will read the files to cunstruct the training-test-validation data.

## Model
Model directory includes .py codes for the data preprocessing and ML Models. The .py files in this directory include: RandomData, dataPrep, fourModels, and dataType

## spatialEnv
This directory is the virtual environment. All the requirements of the model are stored in spatialEnv directory.
